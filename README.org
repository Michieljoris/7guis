    nvm use
    bin/dev-install-js

* Good to know
The css of semantic ui downloads a google font:

@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,700,400italic,700italic&subset=latin);

 When working offline this blocks refreshing the page. A quick turnaround is to
 comment out this import in node_modules/semantic-ui-css/semantic.css
