* BookIdeas (by Michiel on Sat 21 Jan 2012 18:02:00 EST) -----

A1thou desirest with True Desire to tread the Path of Wizardly Wisdom, first learn the elementary Postures of Kernighan & Pike's The Unix Programming Environment; then, absorb the mantic puissance of March Rochkind's Advanced Unix Programming and W. Richard Stevens's Advanced Programming In The Unix Environment. 

Immerse thyself, then, in the Pure Light of Maurice J. Bach's The Design Of The Unix Operating System.Neglect not the Berkelian Way; study also The Design and Implementation Of The 4.4BSD Operating System by Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic et. al. 

For useful hints, tips, and tricks, see Unix Power Tools, Tim O'Reilly,ed. Consider also the dark Wisdom to be gained from contemplation of the dread Portable C And Unix Systems Programming, e'en though it hath flowed from the keyboard of the mad and doomed Malvernite whom the world of unknowing Man misnames "J. E. Lapin". 

These tomes shall instruct thy Left Brain in the Nature of the Unix System; to Feed the other half of thy Head, O Nobly Born, embrace also the Lore of its Nurture. Don Libes's and Sandy Ressler's Life With Unix will set thy Feet unerringly upon that Path; take as thy Travelling Companion the erratic but illuminating compendium called The New Hacker's Dictionary (Eric S. Raymond, ed., with Guy L. Steele Jr.).

Wiki

. A micro-wiki application with distributed version control

Node needs a generic Wiki application that is both small in size and able to maintain versions of documents across multiple instances. This will allow for a decentralized Wikipedia which could also be sharded onto local storage, and to smaller devices like mobile phones. TiddlyWiki is a neat project by Jeremy Ruston which is built on this idea. Some work has been done with node and TiddyWiki, but I couldn't find anything about using node to synchronize multiple TiddlyWiki instances.
